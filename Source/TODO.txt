implement quadosc as a wavetable
    need a function to read from phi and phi + pi/2 at once
    no detune/spread, but bring back pan + phase

relocate StereoPosition and matrix mult from QuadOsc.h to ... somewhere accessible to synthvoice2

run at 4x...


2 calc squash params as vectors
3 make voice calc 4x FFT forward / cut above downsampled SR
4 ship it out to synth, downsample with HIIR

clean up Oscillator params
